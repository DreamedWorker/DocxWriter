# DocxWriter
This is an application which gives you a more friendly way to write official documents.

## Brief Intro
This is a tool software written in Java, its UI is provided by JavaFX, and its ability to manipulate Open XML files is provided by apache's poi library. We designed this program to allow you to focus on document writing, reduce the impact of formats on your workflow, and hope to bring you a fast and convenient working environment through this software.

Before using this software, we need you to have a basic understanding of the document writing standard **(GB/T 9704-2012)**. If you are using the macOS, we also default that you have a certain programming foundation. This software divides the basic document into several parts, and all you have to do is fill in your article.

## Installation

1. For general users
    - Click on the partition [Release], find the latest entry, and download the .jar file inside.
    - Download the Java runtime environment(JRM, JDK is also fine), we recommend that you download the Java installation package in .dmg format from Microsoft's official website, as this greatly simplifies your steps.
    - Go to the directory where your .jar file is located and specify the terminal's working directory here.
    - Finally, use the [java -jar file_name.jar] command in the terminal to run the app.
